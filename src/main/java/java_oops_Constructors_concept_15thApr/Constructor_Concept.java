	//1.Constructors do not have a return type but methods have a return type
		//2. The name of the constructors always is the class name but methods can have any name
		//3. Constructors get invoked the moment an Object is created. That is not the case with methods.
		//4. Methods can be inherited but constructors cannot be inherited
		//5. Constuctors cannot be made static but methods can be made static
		//
		//private, buptlic, default, protected - can be used with Constructors
		
		//Uses of constuctors
		//1.Constructors are used to initialized an object 
		//(not to create an object. To create an object we use word "new" keyword
		//2. They are used to optimize code
		
		
		//type of constructors:
		//1. Default constructor (this gets invoked the moment an object is created)
		//2. No argument constructor (this is user defined)
		//3. Parameterized constructor (this is user defined)
		
		//Misconception
		//Constructors are used to create an obj. NO!!! not to create an object. 
		//To create an object we use word "new" keyword

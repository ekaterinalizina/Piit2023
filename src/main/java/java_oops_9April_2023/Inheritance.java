public class Inheritance {
	//Classes - Parent, child/sub class
	//these concept will work only if you design a parent and respective Children classes
	//child class inherits some of the properties of the parent class
	//parent class does not inherit from the child class
	//object acquires properties/behavior of its parent object
	
	//Advantages:-
	//Code - reusability
	//We can use polymorphism
	
	//Disadvantage - 2 Classes are tightly coupled with each other
	
	//What you cannot inherit?
	//Private method (only belongs to class itself), 
	//Costructor
	
	//3 types of inheritance
	//Single level, multi-level, Hierarchical

	//Abstr types
	//1.Partial Abstraction - 0- 100% - Abstract Class
	//2. Complete abstraction - Interface
	
	//now we have to create body of unimplemented methods from parent abstract class
		//we can also add parameters in overriding method = me can overload them
	
	
	//Abstract class cannot be instantiated on its own.
	//so it doesn't make much sense to have instance variable, we can't call them, because we can't create an obj of
	//abst class.
